## üåü Overview

**Ant Hunger War** is an interactive simulation that models ant colony behavior with competitive elements. Watch as virtual ants forage for food, establish trails, engage in territorial conflicts, and occasionally return as ghosts. This project demonstrates emergent behavior patterns through simple rule sets and swarm intelligence.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Dynamic Ant Simulation**: Observe realistic ant foraging behaviors with pheromone trails
- **Competitive Elements**: Ants may enter "rage mode" and fight for food resources
- **Ghost Mechanics**: Fallen ants might return as ghost ants with unique behaviors
- **Fully Customizable**: Adjust all simulation parameters in real-time
- **Educational Value**: Learn about swarm intelligence and emergent behaviors

This project is engineered with modern, lightweight web technologies:

- **HTML5**: Provides semantic structure and Canvas API for real-time graphics rendering
- **CSS3**: Implements responsive design, visual effects, and interface aesthetics 
- **JavaScript**: Powers the simulation engine with object-oriented design patterns

The implementation uses pure vanilla technologies without external dependencies, ensuring optimal performance and minimal overhead.

## üß™ How It Works
The simulation architecture implements these core computational principles:

1. **Autonomous Agent Behavior**: Each ant operates as an independent entity with its own decision-making logic
2. **Pheromone Communication System**: Digital "scent" trails create a sophisticated stigmergic information network
3. **Resource Detection Algorithm**: Ants employ proximity-based detection mechanisms within configurable perception radii
4. **Conflict Resolution Protocol**: Dynamic interactions occur when entities breach territorial thresholds
5. **State Transformation Engine**: Probabilistic state machine governs ant-to-ghost transformation mechanics

This architecture demonstrates how complex emergent behaviors arise from simple rule-based systems, making it an excellent study in swarm intelligence and multi-agent systems.

## üîÆ Research & Experimentation

The simulation serves as an experimental platform for exploring complex systems and swarm intelligence concepts:

### Suggested Experiments

| Scenario | Setup | Expected Observations |
|----------|-------|------------------------|
| **Population Collapse** | High ghost chance, low food count | Observe system stability thresholds and extinction dynamics |
| **Territorial Warfare** | High rage radius, clustered food distribution | Formation of defensive boundaries and resource monopolies |
| **Optimized Foraging** | Extended trail length, scattered resources | Emergence of efficient path networks and route optimization |
| **Resource Scarcity** | Low food count, high ant population | Competition strategies and adaptive behavior under pressure |
| **Ghost Ecosystem** | 100% ghost chance, varied speed settings | Study of predator-prey relationships and population cycles |

### Applications

This simulation framework demonstrates principles applicable to:

- Distributed logistics and supply chain optimization
- Robotic swarm coordination algorithms
- Traffic flow modeling and optimization
- Self-organizing network protocols
- Resource allocation in competitive environments
